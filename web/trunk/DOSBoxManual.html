  NOTE: <br />
  ======</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we are hoping that one day DOSBox will run all programs ever made for the PC, we are not there yet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present, DOSBox running on a high-end machine will roughly be
the equivalent of a Pentium I PC. DOSBox can be configured to run a wide range of DOS games, from CGA/Tandy/PCjr 
  classics up to games from the Quake era.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Type INTRO in DOSBox for a quick tour. </strong><br />
  It is essential that you get familiar with the idea of mounting, DOSBox does not automatically make any drive (or a part of it) accessible to the emulation. See the FAQ entry 
  &quot;How to start?&quot; as well as the description of the MOUNT command (section 4: &quot;Internal Programs&quot;). If you have your game on a cdrom you may try this guide:

<p><a name="START"></a></p>
<h4>START: How to start?</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>At the beginning you've got a Z:\&gt; instead of a C:\&gt; at the prompt. You have to make your directories available as drives in DOSBox by using the &quot;mount&quot; 
    command. For example, in Windows &quot;mount C D:\GAMES&quot; will give you a C drive in DOSBox which points to your Windows D:\GAMES directory (that was created before). 
    In Linux, &quot;mount c /home/username&quot; will give you a C drive in DOSBox which points to /home/username in Linux. To change to the drive mounted like above, type &quot;C:&quot;. 
    If everything went fine, DOSBox will display the prompt &quot;C:\&gt;&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="AUTOMATION"></a></p>
<h4> AUTOMATION: Do I always have to type these commands?</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the DOSBox configuration file is an [autoexec] section. The commands present there are run when DOSBox starts, so you can use this section for the mounting. Look at 
    Section 13: The configuration (options) file</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="FULLSCREEN"></a></p>
<h4> FULLSCREEN: How do I change to fullscreen? </h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Press alt-enter. Alternatively: Edit the configuration file of DOSBox and change the option fullscreen=false to fullscreen=true. If fullscreen looks wrong in your opinion: 
    Play with the options: fullresolution, output and aspect in the configuration file of DOSBox. To get back from fullscreen mode: Press alt-enter again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="WINSCALE"></a></p>
<h4> FULLSCREEN: My fullscreen is too large. </h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is can be a problem on Windows 10, if you have display scaling
    set to a value above 100%. Windows in that case will resize the screen
    on top of dosbox resizing the screen, which can happen for the output:
    ddraw, opengl, openglnb, overlay. You can disable this Windows behaviour
    by enabling a specific compatibility setting:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>- Right-click the DOSBox icon and select "Properties".<br />
- Go to the "Compatibility" tab.<br />
- Click on "Change high DPI settings".<br />
- Tick "Override high DPI scaling behaviour" and set it to "Application".<br />
- Apply the changes by clicking on "OK".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
    Unfortunately, this compatibility option causes some side effects in
    windowed mode, and in this case you will need to change the resolution
    in the config/Options file for windowresolution (e.g. 1024x768).
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
    Alternatively, you can disable the display scaling and or use a lower
    fullresolution value.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="CD_ROM"></a></p>
<h4>CD-ROM: My CD-ROM doesn't work.</h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>To mount your CD-ROM in DOSBox you have to specify some additional options when mounting the CD-ROM.<br />
    To enable CD-ROM support (includes MSCDEX) in Windows: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>- mount d f:\ -t cdrom </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>in Linux: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>- mount d /media/cdrom -t cdrom</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In some cases you might want to use a different CD-ROM interface, for example if CD audio does not work: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>To enable SDL-support (does not include low-level CD access!):</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>- mount d f:\ -t cdrom -usecd 0 -noioctl </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To enable ioctl access using digital audio extraction for CD audio (windows-only, useful for Vista): </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>- mount d f:\ -t cdrom -ioctl_dx </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To enable ioctl access using MCI for CD audio (windows-only): </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>- mount d f:\ -t cdrom -ioctl_mci </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To force ioctl-only access (windows-only): </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>- mount d f:\ -t cdrom -ioctl_dio </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To enable low-level aspi-support (win98 with aspi-layer installed): </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>- mount d f:\ -t cdrom -aspi</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>explanation:</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>- d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;driveletter you will get in DOSBox (d is the best, don't change it!) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- f:\ &nbsp;&nbsp;location of CD-ROM on your PC. In most cases it will be d:\ or e:\<br />
      - 0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of the CD-ROM drive, reported by &quot;mount -cd&quot;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(note that this value is only needed when using SDL for CD audio, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>otherwise it is ignored) </p>
      </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>See also the next question: The game/application can't find its CD-ROM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="CantFindCD"></a></p>
<h4> CD-ROM: The game/application can't find its CD-ROM</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Be sure to mount the CD-ROM with -t cdrom switch, this will enable the MSCDEX interface required by DOS games to interface with CD-ROMs. Also try adding the correct label 
    (-label LABEL) to the mount command, where LABEL is the CD-label (volume ID) of the CD-ROM. Under Windows you can specify -ioctl, -aspi or -noioctl. Look at the description 
    of the mount command in Section 4: &quot;Internal programs&quot; for their meaning and the additional audio-CD related options -ioctl_dx, -ioctl_mci, -ioctl_dio. Try creating 
    a CD-ROM image (preferably CUE/BIN pair) and use the DOSBox's internal <a href="#IMGMOUNT">IMGMOUNT</a> tool to mount the image (the CUE sheet). This enables very good low-level 
    CD-ROM support on any operating system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="MOUSE"></a></p>
<h4> MOUSE: The mouse doesn't work. </h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Usually, DOSBox detects when a game uses mouse control. When you click on the screen it should get locked (confined to the DOSBox window) and work. With certain games, 
    the DOSBox mouse detection doesn't work. In that case you will have to lock the mouse manually by pressing CTRL-F10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="NoSound"></a></p>
<h4> SOUND: There is no sound</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Be sure that the sound is correctly configured in the game. This might be done during the installation or with a setup/setsound utility that accompanies the game. First 
    see if an autodetection option is provided. If there is none try selecting Soundblaster or Soundblaster 16 with the default settings being &quot;address=220 irq=7 dma=1&quot; 
    (sometimes highdma=5). You might also want to select Sound Canvas/SCC/MPU-401/General MIDI/Wave Blaster at &quot;address=330 IRQ=2&quot; as music device. The parameters 
    of the emulated sound cards can be changed in the DOSBox configuration file.</p>
  <p><br />
    If you still don't get any sound set the core to normal in DOSBox configuration and use some lower fixed cycles value (like cycles=2000). Also<br />
    assure that your host operating sound does provide sound. In certain cases it might be useful to use a different emulated sound device<br />
    like a soundblaster pro (sbtype=sbpro1 in the DOSBox configuration file) or the gravis ultrasound (gus=true).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="SoundHardware"></a></p>
<h4> SOUND: What sound hardware does DOSBox presently emulate?</h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>DOSBox emulates several legacy sound devices: </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Internal PC speaker/Buzzer</strong><br />
    This emulation includes both the tone generator and several forms of<br />
    digital sound output through the internal speaker. </li>
  <li><strong>Creative CMS/Gameblaster</strong><br />
    The is the first card released by Creative Labs(R). The default configuration places it on address 220. It is disabled as default.</li>
  <li><strong>Tandy 3 voice</strong><br />
    The emulation of this sound hardware is complete with the exception of the noise channel. The noise channel is not very well documented and as such is only a best guess 
    as to the sound's accuracy. It is disabled as default. </li>
  <li><strong>Tandy DAC</strong><br />
    Some games may require turning off sound blaster emulation (sbtype=none) for better tandy DAC sound support. Don't forget to set the sbtype back to sb16 if you don't use 
    tandy sound. </li>
  <li><strong>Adlib</strong><br />
    This emulation is almost perfect and includes the Adlib's ability to almost play digitized sound. Placed at address 220 (also on 388).</li>
  <li><strong>SoundBlaster 16 / SoundBlaster Pro I &amp; II / SoundBlaster I &amp; II</strong><br />
    By default DOSBox provides Soundblaster 16 level 16-bit stereo sound. You can select a different SoundBlaster version in the configuration of DOSBox. AWE32 music is not 
    emulated as you can use MPU-401 instead (see below). </li>
  <li><strong>Disney Sound Source and Covox Speech Thing</strong><br />
    Using the printer port, this sound device outputs digital sound only. Placed at LPT1 </li>
  <li><strong>Gravis Ultrasound</strong><br />
    The emulation of this hardware is nearly complete, though the MIDI capabilities have been left out, since an MPU-401 has been emulated in other code. For Gravis music you 
    also have to install Gravis drivers inside DOSBox. It is disabled as default. </li>
  <li><strong>MPU-401</strong><br />
    A MIDI passthrough interface is also emulated. This method of sound output will only work when used with external device/emulator. Every Windows XP/Vista/7 and MAC OS has 
    got a default emulator compatible with: Sound Canvas/SCC/General Standard/General MIDI/Wave Blaster. A different device/emulator is needed for Roland LAPC/CM-32L/MT-32 compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Stutter"></a></p>
<h4> SOUND: The sound stutters or sounds stretched/weird.</h4>
<p>You may be using too much CPU power to keep DOSBox running at the current speed. You can lower the cycles, skip frames, reduce the sampling rate of the respective sound device, 
  increase the prebuffer. See section 13: &quot;The configuration (options) file&quot;<br />
  If you are using cycles=max or =auto, then make sure that there is no background processes interfering! (especially if they access the harddisk) Also look at Section 10. &quot;How 
  to speed up/slow down DOSBox&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Backslash"></a></p>
<h4> KEYBOARD: I can't type \ or : in DOSBox.</h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>This can happen in various cases, like your host keyboard layout does not have a matching DOS layout representation (or it was not correctly detected), or the key mapping 
    is wrong.<br />
    Some possible fixes: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use / instead, or ALT-58 for : and ALT-92 for \. </li>
    <li>Change the DOS keyboard layout (see Section 8: Keyboard Layout). </li>
    <li>Add the commands you want to execute to the [autoexec] section of the DOSBox configuration file. </li>
    <li>Open the DOSBox configuration file and change the usescancodes entry. </li>
    <li>Switch the keyboard layout of your operating system.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Note that if the host layout can not be identified, or keyboardlayout is set to none in the DOSBox configuration file, the standard US layout is used. In this configuration 
    try the keys around &quot;enter&quot; for the key \ (backslash), and for the key : (colon) use shift and the keys between &quot;enter&quot; and &quot;L&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="BackslashWin"></a></p>
<h4> KEYBOARD: Right Shift and &quot;\&quot; doesn't work in DOSBox. (Windows only) </h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>This may happen if Windows thinks that you have more than one keyboard connected to your PC when you use some remote control devices. To verity this problem run cmd.exe, 
    navigate to DOSBox program folder and type: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>set sdl_videodriver=windib<br />
      dosbox.exe</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>check whether keyboard started to work properly. As windib is slower it is best to use one of the two solutions provided here: <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=24072">https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=24072</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="KeyboardLag"></a></p>
<h4> KEYBOARD: The keyboard lags</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Lower the priority setting in the DOSBox configuration file, for example set &quot;priority=normal,normal&quot;. You might also want to try lowering the cycles (use a fixed 
    cycle amount to start with, like cycles=10000).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="CONTROL"></a></p>
<h4> CONTROL: The character/cursor/mouse pointer always moves into one direction!</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>See if it still happens if you disable the joystick emulation, set joysticktype=none in the [joystick] section of your DOSBox configuration file. Maybe also try unplugging 
    any joystick/gamepad. If you want to use the joystick in the game, try setting timed=false and be sure to calibrate the joystick (both in your OS as well as in the game 
    or the game's setup program).</p>

<p><a name="SPEED"></a></p>
<h4> SPEED: The game/application runs much too slow/too fast!</h4>

<p><a name="Build"></a></p>
<h4> GAME: My Build game(Duke3D/Blood/Shadow Warrior) has problems</h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>First of all, try to find a port of the game. Those will offer a better experience. To fix the graphics problem that occurs in DOSBox on higher resolutions: Open the configuration 
    file of DOSBox and search for:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> machine=svga_s3. Change svga_s3 to vesa_nolfb<br />
      Change memsize=16 to memsize=63</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="SAFETY"></a></p>
<h4> SAFETY: Can DOSBox harm my computer?</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>DOSBox can not harm your computer more than any other resource demanding program. Increasing the cycles does not overclock your real CPU. Setting the cycles too high has 
    a negative performance effect on the software running inside DOSBox.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A rather unusual example, just to demonstrate what you can do (Windows): dosbox D:\folder\file.exe -c &quot;MOUNT Y H:\MyFolder&quot; This mounts D:\folder as C:\ and runs 
  file.exe. Before it does that, it will first mount H:\MyFolder as the Y drive. In Windows, you can also drag directories/files onto the DOSBox executable.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Note: It's possible to mount a local directory as CD-ROM drive, but hardware support is then missing.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Basically MOUNT allows you to connect real hardware to DOSBox's emulated PC. So MOUNT C C:\GAMES tells DOSBox to use your C:\GAMES directory as drive C: in DOSBox. MOUNT 
    C E:\SomeFolder tells DOSBox to use your E:\SomeFolder directory as drive C: in DOSBox.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> <span class="Alert">Mounting your entire C drive with MOUNT C C:\ is NOT recommended!</span> The same is true for mounting the root of any other drive, except for CD-ROMs 
    (due to their read-only nature). Otherwise if you or DOSBox make a mistake you may lose all your files. Also never mount a &quot;Windows&quot; or &quot;Program Files&quot; 
    folders or their subfolders in Windows Vista/7 as DOSBox may not work correctly, or will stop working correctly later. It is recommended to keep all your dos applications/games 
    in a simple folder (for example c:\dosgames) and mount that.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> You should always install your game inside DOSBox. So if you have the game on CD you always (even after installation!) have to mount both: folder as a harddisk drive and 
    a CD-ROM.<br />
    HardDisk should always be mounted as c<br />
    CD-ROM should always be mounted as d<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floppy should always be mounted as a (or b)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>Basic MOUNT Examples for normal usage (Windows):</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>To mount a folder as a harddisk drive:<br />
      mount c d:\dosgames<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>To mount your CD-ROM drive E as CD-ROM drive D in DOSBox:<br />
      mount d e:\ -t cdrom<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>To mount your drive a: as a floppy:<br />
      mount a a:\ -t floppy</li>
  </ol>
  <p> <b>Advanced MOUNT examples (Windows):</b></p>
  <ol start="4">
    <li> To mount a hard disk drive with ~870 mb free diskspace (simple version):<br />
      mount c d:\dosgames -freesize 870<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>To mount a drive with ~870 mb free diskspace (experts only, full control):<br />
      mount c d:\dosgames -size 512,127,16513,13500<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>To mount c:\dosgames\floppy as a floppy:<br />
      mount a c:\dosgames\floppy -t floppy</li>
  </ol>
  <p><b>Other MOUNT examples:</b></p>
  <ol start="7">
    <li>To mount system CD-ROM drive at mountpoint /media/cdrom as CD-ROM drive D in DOSBox:<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mount d /media/cdrom -t cdrom -usecd 0<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>To mount /home/user/dosgames as drive C in DOSBox:<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mount c /home/user/dosgames<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>To mount the directory where DOSBox was started as C in DOSBox:<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mount c .<br />
      (note the . which represents the directory where DOSBox was started, on Windows Vista/7 don't use this if you installed DOSBox to your &quot;Program Files&quot; folder)</li>
  </ol>
  <p> If you want to mount a CD image or floppy image, check <a href="#IMGMOUNT">IMGMOUNT</a>.<br />
    MOUNT also works with images but only if you use external program, for example (both are free): </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/home" target="_blank">Daemon Tools Lite</a> (for CD images)</li>
    <li><a href="http://chitchat.at.infoseek.co.jp/vmware/vfd.html" target="_blank">Virtual Floppy Drive</a> (for floppy images)</li>

  <p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Both &quot;-set&quot; and &quot;-get&quot; work from batch files and can be used to set up your own preferences for each game. Although it may be easier to use separate DOSBox's

        For example, to mount a 70MB image as the slave drive device, you would type (without the quotes):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;imgmount 3 d:\test.img -size 512,63,16,142 -fs none&quot;<br />
          Compare this with a mount to be able to access the drive<br />
          within DOSBox, which would read as:<br />
          &quot;imgmount e: d:\test.img -size 512,63,16,142&quot;</p>

<p><strong>IPX</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>You need to enable IPX networking in the configuration file of DOSBox.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> All of the IPX networking is managed through the internal DOSBox program IPXNET. For help on the IPX networking from inside DOSBox, type &quot;IPXNET HELP&quot; (without 
    quotes) and the program will list the commands and relevant documentation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> With regard to actually setting up a network, one system needs to be the server. To set this up, type &quot;IPXNET STARTSERVER&quot; (without the quotes) in a DOSBox session. 
    The server DOSBox session will automatically add itself to the virtual IPX network. For every additional computer that should be part of the virtual IPX network, you'll 
    need to type &quot;IPXNET CONNECT &lt;computer host name or IP&gt;&quot;.<br />
    For example, if your server is at bob.dosbox.com, you would type &quot;IPXNET CONNECT bob.dosbox.com&quot; on every non-server system.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To play games that need Netbios a file named NETBIOS.EXE from Novell is needed. Establish the IPX connection as explained above, then run &quot;netbios.exe&quot;.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The following is an IPXNET command reference:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IPXNET CONNECT</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote> 
    <p> IPXNET CONNECT opens a connection to an IPX tunneling server running on another DOSBox session. The &quot;address&quot; parameter specifies the IP address or host name 
      of the server computer. You can also specify the UDP port to use. By default IPXNET uses port 213 - the assigned IANA port for IPX tunneling - for its connection.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p> Change the keyboard layout. For detailed information about keyboard layouts please see <a href="#KeyboardLayout">Section 8: &quot;Keyboard Layout&quot;</a> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> [keyboardlayoutcode] is a string consisting of five or less characters, examples are PL214 (Polish typists) or PL457 (Polish programmers). It specifies the keyboard layout 
    to be used.<br />
    The list of all layouts built into DOSBox is here:<br />
    <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=21824" target="_blank">https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=21824</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> [codepage] is the number of the codepage to be used. The keyboard layout has to provide support for the specified codepage, otherwise the layout loading will fail. If 
    no codepage is specified, an appropriate codepage for the requested layout is chosen automatically.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> [codepagefile] can be used to load codepages that are yet not compiled into DOSBox. This is only needed when DOSBox does not find the codepage. If no codepagefile is specified, 
    but you place all ten ega.cpx files (from FreeDOS) in the DOSBox program folder, an appropriate codepagefile for the requested layout/codepage is chosen automatically.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Examples:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>To load the polish typist keys layout (automatically uses codepage 852):<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keyb pl214 </li>
    <li>To load one of russian keyboard layouts with codepage 866:<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keyb ru441 866<br />
      In order to type russian characters press ALT+RIGHT-SHIFT. </li>
    <li>To load one of french keyboard layouts with codepage 850 (where the<br />
      codepage is defined in EGACPI.DAT):<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keyb fr189 850 EGACPI.DAT </li>
    <li>To load codepage 858 (without a keyboard layout):<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keyb none 858<br />
      This can be used to change the codepage for the FreeDOS keyb2 utility. </li>
    <li>To display the current codepage and, if loaded, the keyboard layout:<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keyb</li>

<p><strong>*NOTE:</strong> Once you increase your DOSBox cycles beyond your computer CPU resources, it will produce the same effect as slowing down the emulation. This maximum will vary 
  from computer to computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>**NOTE:</strong> You need free CPU resources for this (the more you have, the faster it goes), so it won't work at all with cycles=max or a too high amount of fixed 
  cycles. You have to keep the keys pressed for it to work!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>***NOTE:</strong> These keys won't work if you saved a mapper file earlier with a different machine type. So either reassign them or reset the mapper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the default keybindings. They can be changed in the keymapper (see <a href="#KeyMapper">Section 7: KeyMapper</a>). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In MAC OS you can try using cmd(applekey) together with Ctrl if the key doesn't work eg. cmd-ctrl-F1, but some keys may still need remapping (in Linux too).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You start the DOSBox mapper either with CTRL-F1 (see section 5. Special Keys) or -startmapper (see Section 3. Command Line Parameters). You are presented with a virtual keyboard 
  and a virtual joystick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These virtual devices correspond to the keys and events DOSBox will report to the DOS applications. If you click on a button with your mouse, you can see in the lower left 
  corner with which event it is associated (EVENT) and to what events it is currently bound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>Event: EVENT
BIND: BIND (the real key/button/axis you push with your finger/hand)

  <p>The key or joystick axis/button/hat DOSBox will report to DOS applications. (the event that will happen during the game, (eg. shooting/jumping/walking)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
  <strong>BIND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The key on your real keyboard or the axis/button/hat on your real joystick(s) (as reported by SDL), which is connected to the EVENT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
  <strong>mod1,2,3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Modifiers. These are keys you need to have to be pressed while pressing BIND. mod1 = CTRL and mod2 = ALT. These are generally only used when you want to change the special 
    keys of DOSBox.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Add a new BIND to this EVENT. Basically add a key from your keyboard or an event from the joystick (button press, axis/hat movement) which will produce the EVENT in DOSBox.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
  <strong>Del</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Delete the BIND to this EVENT. If an EVENT has no BINDS, then it is not possible to trigger this event in DOSBox (that is there's no way to type the key or use the respective 
    action of the joystick).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
  <strong>Next</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Go through the list of bindings which map to this EVENT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q1.</strong> You want to have the X on your keyboard to type a Z in DOSBox.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A.</strong> Click on the Z on the keyboard mapper. Click &quot;Add&quot;. Now press the X key on your keyboard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q2.</strong> If you click &quot;Next&quot; a couple of times, you will notice that the Z on your keyboard also produces an Z in DOSBox. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A.</strong> Therefore select the Z again, and click &quot;Next&quot; until you have the Z on<br />
    your keyboard. Now click &quot;Del&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q3.</strong> If you try it out in DOSBox, you will notice that pressing X makes ZX appear. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A.</strong> The X on your keyboard is still mapped to the X as well! Click on the X in the keyboard mapper and search with &quot;Next&quot; until you find the mapped key 
    X. Click &quot;Del&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <b>Examples about remapping the joystick:</b></p>
<p>You have a joystick attached, it is working fine under DOSBox and you want to play some keyboard-only game with the joystick (it is assumed that the game is controlled by 
  the arrows on the keyboard):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start the mapper, then click on one of the left keyboard arrow. EVENT should be key_left. Now click on Add and move your joystick in the respective direction, this should 
    add an event to the BIND. </li>
  <li>Repeat the above for the missing three directions, additionally the buttons of the joystick can be remapped as well (fire/jump).</li>
  <li>Click on Save, then on Exit and test it with some game.</li>
</ol>
<p> You want to swap the y-axis of the joystick because some flightsim uses the up/down joystick movement in a way you don't like, and it is not configurable in the game itself: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start the mapper and click on Y- in the first joystick field. EVENT should be jaxis_0_1-. </li>
  <li>Click on Del to remove the current binding, then click Add and move your joystick downwards. A new bind should be created. </li>
  <li>Repeat this for Y+, save the layout and finally test it with some game.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to remap anything to your d-pad/hat you will have to change 'joysticktype=auto' to 'joysticktype=fcs' in configuration file. Maybe this will be improved in the 
  next dosbox version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If you change the default mapping, you can save your changes by clicking on &quot;Save&quot;. DOSBox will save the mapping to a location specified in the configuration file 
  (the mapperfile= entry). At startup, DOSBox will load your mapperfile, if it is present in the DOSBox configuration file.</p>

<h4>===================<br />
  8. Keyboard Layout:<br />
  ===================</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To switch to a different keyboard layout, either the entry &quot;keyboardlayout&quot; in the [dos] section of the DOSBox configuration file can be used, or the internal DOSBox 
  program keyb.com (Section 4: Internal Programs) Both accept DOS conforming language codes (see below), but only by using keyb.com a custom codepage can be specified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The default keyboardlayout=auto currently works under windows only. The language is chosen according to the OS language, but the keyboard layout is not detected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Layout switching</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>DOSBox supports a number of keyboard layouts and codepages by default, in this case just the layout identifier needs to be specified (like keyboardlayout=PL214 in the DOSBox 
    configuration file, or using &quot;keyb PL214&quot; at the DOSBox command prompt). The list of all layouts built into DOSBox is here: <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=21824" target="_blank">https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=21824</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Some keyboard layouts (for example layout GK319 codepage 869 and layout RU441 codepage 808) have support for dual layouts that can be accessed by pressing LeftALT+RrightSHIFT 
    for one layout and LeftALT+LeftSHIFT for the other. Some keyboard layouts (for example layout LT456 codepage 771) have support for three layouts, third can be accessed by 
    pressing LeftALT+LeftCTRL</p>

<p>The FreeDOS .kl files are supported (FreeDOS keyb2 keyboard layoutfiles) as well as the FreeDOS keyboard.sys/keybrd2.sys/keybrd3.sys libraries which consist of all available 
  .kl files. See <a href="http://www.freedos.org/" target="_blank">http://www.freedos.org/</a> for precompiled keyboard layouts if the DOSBox-integrated layouts don't work for 
  some reason, or if updated or new layouts become available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Both .CPI (MS-DOS and compatible codepage files) and .CPX (FreeDOS UPX-compressed codepage files) can be used. Some codepages are compiled into DOSBox, so it is mostly not 
  needed to care about external codepage files. If you need a different (or custom) codepage file, copy it into the directory of the DOSBox so it is accessible for DOSBox. If 
  you place all ten ega.cpx files (from FreeDOS) in DOSBox folder, an appropriate codepagefile for the requested layout/codepage is chosen automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Additional layouts can be added by copying the corresponding .kl file into the directory of the DOSBox configuration file and using the first part of the filename as language 
  code. </p>
<p><br />
  Example: For the file UZ.KL (keyboard layout for Uzbekistan) specify &quot;keyboardlayout=uz&quot; in the DOSBox configuration file.<br />
  The integration of keyboard layout packages (like keybrd2.sys) works similar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the keyboard layout allows foreign characters to be entered, but there is NO support for them in filenames. Try to avoid them both inside DOSBox as well as in files 
  on your host operating system that are accessible by DOSBox.</p>

<h4>==============================<br />
  9. Serial Multiplayer feature:<br />
  ==============================</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DOSBox can emulate a serial nullmodem cable over network and internet. It can be configured through the [serialports] section in the DOSBox configuration file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create a nullmodem connection, one side needs to act as the server and one as the client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The server needs to be set up in the DOSBox configuration file like this: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>serial1=nullmodem</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The client:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>serial1=nullmodem server:&lt;IP or name of the server&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now start your game and choose nullmodem / serial cable / already connected as multiplayer method on COM1. Set the same baudrate on both computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, additional parameters can be specified to control the behavior of the nullmodem connection. These are all parameters:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>=====================================<br />
  10. How to speed up/slow down DOSBox:<br />
  =====================================</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DOSBox emulates the CPU, the sound and graphic cards, and other peripherals of a PC, all at the same time. The speed of an emulated DOS application depends on how many instructions 
  can be emulated, which is adjustable (number of cycles).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CPU Cycles (speed up/slow down)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>By default (cycles=auto) DOSBox tries to detect whether a game needs to be run with as many instructions emulated per time interval as possible (cycles=max, sometimes this 
    results in game working too fast or unstable), or whether to use fixed amount of cycles (cycles=3000, sometimes this results in game working too slow or too fast). But you 
    can always manually force a different setting in the DOSBox's configuration file.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> You can force the slow or fast behavior by setting a fixed amount of cycles in the DOSBox's configuration file. If you for example set cycles=10000, then DOSBox window 
    will display a line &quot;Cpu Speed: fixed 10000 cycles&quot; at the top. In this mode you can reduce the amount of cycles even more by hitting CTRL-F11 (you can go as low 
    as you want) or raise it by hitting CTRL-F12 as much as you want, but you will be limited by the power of one core of your computer's CPU. You can see how much free time 
    your real CPU's cores have by looking at the Task Manager in Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7 and the System Monitor in Windows 95/98/ME. Once 100% of the power of your computer's 
    real CPU's one core is used, there is no further way to speed up DOSBox (it will actually start to slow down), unless you reduce the load generated by the non-CPU parts 
    of DOSBox. DOSBox can use only one core of your CPU, so If you have for example a CPU with 4 cores, DOSBox will not be able to use the power of three other cores.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> You can also force the fast behavior by setting cycles=max in the DOSBox configuration file. The DOSBox window will display a line &quot;Cpu Speed: max 100% cycles&quot; 
    at the top then. This time you won't have to care how much free time your real CPU's cores have, because DOSBox will always use 100% of your real CPU's one core. In this 
    mode you can reduce the amount of your real CPU's core usage by CTRL-F11 or raise it with CTRL-F12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CPU Core (speed up)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>On x86 architectures you can try to force the usage of a dynamically recompiling core (set core=dynamic in the DOSBox configuration file). This usually gives better results 
    if the auto detection (core=auto) fails. It is best accompanied by cycles=max. But you may also try using it with high amounts of cycles (for example 20000 or more). Note 
    that there might be games that work worse/crash with the dynamic core (so save your game often), or do not work at all!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Graphics emulation (speed up)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>VGA emulation is a demanding part of DOSBox in terms of actual CPU usage. Increase the number of frames skipped (in increments of one) by pressing CTRL-F8. Your CPU usage 
    should decrease when using a fixed cycle setting, and you will be able to increase cycles with CTRL-F12. You can repeat this until the game runs fast enough for you. Please 
    note that this is a trade-off: you lose in fluidity of video what you gain in speed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sound emulation (speed up)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can also try to disable the sound through the setup utility of the game to reduce load on your CPU further. Setting nosound=true in DOSBox's configuration does NOT 
    disable the emulation of sound devices, just the output of sound will be disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also try to close every program but DOSBox to reserve as much resources as possible for DOSBox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Advanced cycles configuration:</p>
<p>The cycles=auto and cycles=max settings can be parameterized to have different startup defaults. The syntax is</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>cycles=auto [&quot;realmode default&quot;] [&quot;protected mode default&quot;%] [limit &quot;cycle limit&quot;]<br />
    cycles=max [&quot;protected mode default&quot;%] [limit &quot;cycle limit&quot;] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>cycles=auto 5000 80% limit 20000<br />
    will use cycles=5000 for real mode games, 80% CPU throttling for protected mode games along with a hard cycle limit of 20000</p>

<h4>====================<br />
  11. Troubleshooting:<br />
  ====================</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>General tip:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Check messages in DOSBox Status Window. <a href="#StatusWindow">See section 12. &quot;DOSBox Status Window&quot;</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DOSBox crashes right after starting it:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>use different values for the output= entry in your DOSBox configuration file </li>
  <li>try to update your graphics card driver and DirectX </li>
  <li>(Linux) set the environment variable SDL_AUDIODRIVER to alsa or oss.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Running a certain game closes DOSBox, crashes with some message or hangs:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>see if it works with a default DOSBox installation (unmodified configuration file) try it with sound disabled (use the sound configuration program that comes with the 
    game, additionally you can set sbtype=none and gus=false in the DOSBox configuration file) </li>
  <li>change some entries of the DOSBox configuration file, especially try:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;core=normal<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fixed cycles (for example cycles=10000)<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ems=false<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xms=false<br />
    or combinations of the above settings, similar the machine settings that control the emulated chipset and functionality:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine=vesa_nolfb<br />
    or<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine=vgaonly </li>
  <li>use loadfix before starting the game</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The game exits to the DOSBox prompt with some error message:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>read the error message closely and try to locate the error </li>
  <li>try the hints at the above sections </li>
  <li>mount differently as some games are picky about the locations, for example if you used &quot;mount d d:\oldgames\game&quot; try &quot;mount c d:\oldgames\game&quot; and 
    &quot;mount c d:\oldgames&quot; </li>
  <li>if the game requires a CD-ROM be sure you used &quot;-t cdrom&quot; when mounting and try different additional parameters (the ioctl, usecd and label switches, see the 
    appropriate section) </li>
  <li>check the file permissions of the game files (remove read-only attributes, add write permissions etc.) </li>
  <li>try reinstalling the game within DOSBox</li>
</ul>

<h4>=========================<br />
  12. DOSBox Status Window:<br />
  =========================</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DOSBox's Staus window contains many useful information about your currant configuration, your actions in DOSBox, errors that happened and more. Whenever you have any problem 
  with DOSBox check these messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start DOSBox Status Window:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(Windows) Status Window is being started together with main DOSBox window.<br />
    (Linux) You may have to start DOSBox from a console to see Status Window.<br />
    (MAC OS X) Right click on DOSBox.app, choose &quot;Show Package Contents&quot;-&gt;enter &quot;Contents&quot;-&gt;enter &quot;MacOS&quot;-&gt;run &quot;DOSBox&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="ConfigFile"></a></p>
<h4>=====================================<br />
  13. The configuration (options) file:<br />
  =====================================</h4>
<p>The configuration file is automatically created the first time you run DOSBox. The file can be found in:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(Windows) &quot;Start/WinLogo Menu&quot;-&gt;&quot;All Programs&quot;-&gt;DOSBox-0.74-3-&gt;Options</p>
  <p>(Linux) ~/.dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3.conf</p>
  <p>(MAC OS X) &quot;~/Library/Preferences/DOSBox 0.74-3 Preferences&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The file is divided into several sections. Each section starts with a [section name] line. The settings are the property=value lines where value can be altered to customize 
  DOSBox.<br />
  # and % indicate comment-lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An extra configuration file can be generated by CONFIG.COM, which can be found on the internal DOSBox Z: drive when you start up DOSBox. Look in the <a href="#InternalPrograms">Section 
  4: &quot;Internal programs&quot;</a> for usage of CONFIG.COM. You can start DOSBox with the -conf switch to load the generated file and use its settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DOSBox will load configuration files that are specified with -conf. If none were specified, it will try to load &quot;dosbox.conf&quot; from the local directory. If there 
  is none, DOSBox will load the user configuration file. This file will be created if it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important!:</strong> In Windows Vista/7 the configuration file won't work correctly if it is located in &quot;Windows&quot; or &quot;Program Files&quot; folder or their subfolders, 
  or directly on c:\, so the best place for storing extra configuration files is for example: C:\oldgames</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="LanguageFile"></a></p>
<h4>======================<br />
  14. The Language File:<br />
  ======================</h4>
<p>A language file can be generated by CONFIG.COM, which can be found on the internal DOSBox Z: drive when you start up DOSBox. Look in the Section 4: &quot;Internal programs&quot; 
  for usage of CONFIG.COM.<br />
  Read the language file, and you will hopefully understand how to change it. Start DOSBox with the -lang switch to use your new language file. Alternatively, you can setup 
  the filename in the configuration file in the [dosbox] section. There's a language= entry that can be changed with the filelocation.</p>

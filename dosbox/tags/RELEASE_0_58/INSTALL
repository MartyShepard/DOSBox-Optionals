Things needed for compilation.

SDL 
	The Simple DirectMedia Library available at http://www.libsdl.org

Curses 
	If you want to enable the debugger you need a curses library.
	ncurses should be installed on just about every unix distro.
	For win32 get pdcurses at http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net

Libpng
    Needed for the screenshots. (--enable-shots when configuring dosbox)
    For win32 get libpng from http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32

Zlib
    Needed by libpng. 
    For win32 get libz (rename to zlib) from http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32


If you want compile from the CVS under a unix system, you'll also need 
automake (>=1.6), autoconf(>=2.50). Should be available at http://www.gnu.org

For building on unix systems.
If you are building from the cvs run ./autogen.sh first before doing the following.

1. ./configure
2. make

In step 1 you could add the following switches --enable-shots this will
enable the screenshot facility, also --enable-debug is a valid switch. This
will enable the internal debugger. (It can be started by pressing - on the
numeric keyboard)

Check the src subdir for the binary.

Compiling on FreeBSD might be a problem since SDL has no joystick support there.
To get around this edit sdlmain.cpp to enable some #define.
Let's hope someday the sdl people will just report 0 joysticks in freebsd or get it working some other way :)


Build instructions for VC++6 

Open the workspace in the visualc subdir and build from there.

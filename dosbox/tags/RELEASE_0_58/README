DOSBox v0.58

Usage:
======

With the new internal shell,we've changed the command line a bit,
so let's just give some examples of what you can do now.

dosbox 
  With nothing on the command line you'll end up on the internal drive and 
  from there you can mount directories as drives.
dosbox [filename/directory]
  If dosbox detects a directory it'll mount that as the C: drive 
    and then start the shell from c:\.
  If dosbox doesn't detect a directory it'll assume you mean an executable.
    This can be .bat .com .exe. Doesn't need to have extension included. 
    It will mount the directory the file is in as the C: drive.
    Then start up the shell which will start the file.

There also are a couple of command line switches.

dosbox -fullscreen
    starts dosbox in fullscreen mode.
dosbox -conf file
    loads file as a configfile.
dosbox -lang file
    loads file as a languagefile.

You can also add commands to be executed before the main program starts.
Or you can use them to start the program. 
To add commands use the -c command line switch.

For example:

dosbox c:\atlantis\atlantis.exe -c "MOUNT D C:\SAVES"
  This would mount c:\atlanis as c:\ and run atlantis.exe.
  Before it does that it would first mount C:\SAVES as the D drive.

In Windows you can also drag directories/files on the dosbox executable.

Internal Programs:
==================

MOUNT 
Program to mount local directories as drives inside DOSBox. 
The option -t <type> specifies the media: Where <type> can be.
   dir    = harddisk
   floppy = floppy drive
   cdrom  = cdrom drive

The option -cd lists all found cdrom drives and their id.
The option -usecd [x] forces to use the cdrom number x (id as shown in list -cd)

The option -aspi forces to use aspi driver
  (only valid if mounting a cdrom and on Windows systems with ASPI-Layer).
The option -ioctl forces to use ioctl functions
  (only valid if mounting a cdrom and on Win2000/XP/NT systems).

For example to mount c:\floppy as a floppy : mount a c:\floppy -t floppy
For example to mount system cdrom drive e as cdrom drive d in dosbox 
  mount d e:\ -t cdrom
For example to mount system cdrom drive at mountpoint /media/cdrom as cdrom 
drive d in dosbox
  mount d /media/cdrom -t cdrom -usecd 0

It is also possible to mount a directory as cdrom, but it's limited.

MEM
Program to display the amount of free memory

CONFIG
Utility for generating a config file and language file.
The option -writeconf filename is used to write the current config settings. 
The option -writelang filename is used to write the current language strings.

For more information use the the /? command line switch with the programs.

The Config File:
===============
A config file can be generated by CONFIG.COM, edit it to customize DOSBox.
The file is divided in several sections (the names got [] around it). 
Some sections have options which you can set.
# and % indicate commentlines. 
The generated configfile contains the current settings. You can alter them and
start dosbox with the -conf switch to load the file and use these settings. 

The Language File:
=================
A language file can be generated by CONFIG.COM. 
Read it and you will hopefuly understand how to change it. 
Start Dosbox with -lang switch to use your new language file
Or you can setup the filename in the config file in the [dosbox] section.
There's a language= entry that can be changed with the filename.

Special Keys:
=============

ALT-ENTER       Go full screen and back.
CTRL-F5	        Save a screenshot.
CTRL-F6	        Start/Stop recording sound output to a wave file.
CTRL-F7	        Decrease frameskip.
CTRL-F8	        Increase frameskip.
CTRL-F9         Kill dosbox.
CTRL-F10        Capture/Release the mouse.
CTRL-F11        Slowdown emulation.
CTRL-F12        Speedup emulation.

System requirements:
====================

Fast machine my guess would be pentium-2 400+ to get decent emulation
of games written for an 286 machine.

FAQ:
====

Q: I've got a Z instead of a C at the prompt.
A: In DOSBox you can mount directories as drives
   in win32: mount c D:\ would give you an C in DOSBox which points
   at D:\ in win32
   in linux: mount c /home/username would give you and C in DOSBox
   which points at /home/username in Linux

Q: The mouse doesn't work.
A: Normally dosbox detects the mouse being used by a game, if you click on 
   the screen then it should get locked and work.
   Sometimes the dosbox mouse detection doesn't work with certain games, you
   might have to force to lock the mouse then with ctrl-f10.

Q: The sound stutters.
A: Your using too much cpu power to keep dosbox running at the current speed.
   You can either lower the cycles or skip frames or get a faster machine.

To run resource-demanding games: 
===============================

DOSBox emulates the CPU, the sound and graphic cards, and some other
stuff, all at the same time. You can overclock DOSBox by using CTRL+F12, but
you'll be limited by the power of your actual CPU. You can see how much free
time your true CPU has by looking at the Task Manager in Windows 2000/XP and
the System Monitor in Windows 95/98/ME. Once 100% of your real CPU time is
used there is no further way to speed up DOSBox unless you reduce the load
generated by the non-CPU parts of DOSBox. 

So: 

Close every program but DOSBox 

Overclock DOSBox until 100% of your CPU is used (use the utilities above to
check) 

Since VGA emulation is the most demanding part of DOSBox in terms of actual
CPU usage, we'll start here. Increase the number of frames skipped (in
increments of one) by pressing CRTL+F8. Your CPU usage should decrease.
Go back one step and repeat this until the game runs fast enough for you.
Please note that this is a trade off: you lose in fluidity of video what you
gain in speed 

You can also try to disable the sound through the setup utility of the game
to further reduce load on your CPU. 


Building your own Version DOSBox:
=================================

Dowload the source.
Check the INSTALL in the source distribution.

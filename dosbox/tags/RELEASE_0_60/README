DOSBox v0.60

=====
NOTE: 
=====

While we hope that, one day, DosBox will run virtually all programs
ever made for the PC...we are not there yet. At present, DosBox run on a 1.7
Gigahertz PC is roughly the equivalent of a 25MHz 386 PC. While the 0.60
release has added support for "protected mode" allowing for more complex and
recent programs, but note that this support is early in development and
nowhere near as complete as the support for 386 real-mode games (or
earlier). Also note that "protected mode" games need substantially more
resources and may require a much faster processor for you to run it properly
in DosBox.

======
Usage:
======

dosbox [name] [-exit] [-c command] [-fullscreen] [-conf congfigfile] 
       [-lang languagefile]

  name   
        If "name" is a directory it'll mount that as the C: drive.
        If "name" is an executable it'll mount the directory of "name" 
        as the C: drive and execute "name".
    
  -exit  
        dosbox will exit after the "name" has been executed.

  -c command
        Runs the specified command before running "name". Multiple commands
        can be specified. Each command should start with -c though.

  -fullscreen
        Starts dosbox in fullscreen mode.

  -conf configfile
        Start dosbox with the options specified in "configfile".

  -lang languagefile
        Start dosbox using the language string specified in "languagefile".

  -noconsole (Windows Only)
        Start dosbox without showing the console window, output will
	be redirected to stdout.txt and stderr.txt

Note: If a name/command/configfile/languagefile contains a space in it, put
      the whole name/command/configfile/languagefile between quotes("example").

For example:

dosbox c:\atlantis\atlantis.exe -c "MOUNT D C:\SAVES"
  This would mount c:\atlantis as c:\ and run atlantis.exe.
  Before it does that it would first mount C:\SAVES as the D drive.

In Windows you can also drag directories/files onto the dosbox executable.
 


==================
Internal Programs:
==================

dosbox supports most of the DOS commands found in command.com. 
In addition, the following commands are available: 

MOUNT "Emulated Drive letter" "Real Drive or Directory" 
      [-t type] [-aspi] [-ioctl] [-usecd number] [-size drivesize] 
      [-label drivelabel]
MOUNT -cd
    
  Program to mount local directories as drives inside DOSBox.

  "Emulated Drive letter"
        The driveletter inside dosbox (eg. C).

  "Real Drive letter or Directory"
        The local directory you want to have inside dosbox.
        (Under Win32 usually the same as "Emulated Drive letter".
	For Example: mount c c:\ )

  -t type
        Type of the mounted directory. Supported are: dir (standard),
        floppy, cdrom.

  -size drivesize
        Sets the size of the drive. 

  -label drivelabel
        Sets the name of the drive to "drivelabel". Needed on some 
        systems if the cd label isn't read correctly. Useful when a 
        program can't find its cdrom.

  -aspi
        Forces to use the aspi layer. Only valid if mounting a cdrom under 
        Windows systems with an ASPI-Layer.

  -ioctl   
        Forces to use ioctl commands. Only valid if mounting a cdrom under 
        windows which support them (Win2000/XP/NT).

  -usecd number
        Forces to use SDL cdrom support for drive number.
        Number can be found by -cd. Valid on all systems.

  -cd
        Displays all detected cdrom drives and their numbers. Use with -usecd.

  Note: It's possible to mount a local directory as cdrom drive. 
        Hardware support is then missing.

  Basically, MOUNT allows you to connect real hardware to DosBox's "emulated"
  PC. So MOUNT C C:\ tells DosBox to use your real C: drive as drive C: in
  DosBox. It also allows you to change the drive's letter identification for
  programs that demand specific drive letters.
  
  For example: Touche: Adventures of The Fifth Musketeer must be run on your C:
  drive. Using DosBox and it's mount command, you can trick into thinking it
  is on C drive while placing it where you want it. For example, if the game
  were in D:\TOUCHE, you can use the command MOUNT C D:\ would allow you to
  run Touche from the D drive.
    

  General MOUNT Examples:
  1. To mount c:\floppy as a floppy : 
       mount a c:\floppy -t floppy
  2. To mount system cdrom drive E as cdrom drive D in dosbox:
       mount d e:\ -t cdrom
  3. To mount system cdrom drive at mountpoint /media/cdrom as cdrom drive D 
     in dosbox:
       mount d /media/cdrom -t cdrom -usecd 0
  4. To mount a drive with 870 mb free diskspace (rarely needed! experts only):
       mount c d:\ -size 4025,127,16513,1700
  5. to mount /home/dos/dosgames as drive C in dosbox:
       mount c /home/dos/dosgames

MEM
  Program to display the amount of free memory.

CONFIG [-writeconf] [-writelang] localfile
  Write the current configuration or language settings to file.
  "localfile" is located on the local drive !!! 

LOADFIX [-size] [program] [program-parameters]
LOADFIX -f
  Program to "eat up" memory. Useful for old programs which don't expect much
  memory to be free.

  -size	        
        number of kb to "eat up", default = 64kb
  
  -f
        frees all previously allocated memory
  

Examples:
  1. To start mm2.exe and allocate 64kb memory :
     loadfix mm2
  2. To start mm2.exe and allocate 32kb memory :
     loadfix -32 mm2
  3. To free previous allocated memory :
     loadfix -f

For more information use the /? command line switch with the programs.

Special Keys:
=============

ALT-ENTER       Go full screen and back.
CTRL-F5	        Save a screenshot.
CTRL-F6	        Start/Stop recording sound output to a wave file.
CTRL-F7	        Decrease frameskip.
CTRL-F8	        Increase frameskip.
CTRL-F9         Kill dosbox.
CTRL-F10        Capture/Release the mouse.
CTRL-F11        Slow down emulation (Decrease DOSBox Cycles).
CTRL-F12        Speed up emulation (Increase DOSox Cycles).

NOTE: Once you increase your DOSBox cycles beyond your computer's maximum
capacity, it will produce the same effect as slowing down the emulation.
This maximum will vary from computer to computer, there is no standard.

====================
System requirements:
====================

Fast machine. My guess would be pentium-2 400+ to get decent emulation
of games written for an 286 machine.
For protected mode games a 1 Ghz machine is recommended and don't expect
them to run fast though!! Be sure to read the next section on how to speed
it up somewhat.


================================
To run resource-demanding games: 
================================

DOSBox emulates the CPU, the sound and graphic cards, and some other
stuff, all at the same time. You can overclock DOSBox by using CTRL+F12, but
you'll be limited by the power of your actual CPU. You can see how much free
time your true CPU has by looking at the Task Manager in Windows 2000/XP and
the System Monitor in Windows 95/98/ME. Once 100% of your real CPU time is
used there is no further way to speed up DOSBox unless you reduce the load
generated by the non-CPU parts of DOSBox. 

So: 

Close every program but DOSBox 

Overclock DOSBox until 100% of your CPU is used (use the utilities above to
check) 

Since VGA emulation is the most demanding part of DOSBox in terms of actual
CPU usage, we'll start here. Increase the number of frames skipped (in
increments of one) by pressing CRTL+F8. Your CPU usage should decrease.
Go back one step and repeat this until the game runs fast enough for you.
Please note that this is a trade off: you lose in fluidity of video what you
gain in speed 

You can also try to disable the sound through the setup utility of the game
to further reduce load on your CPU.

FAQ:
====

Q: I've got a Z instead of a C at the prompt.
A: In DOSBox you can mount directories as drives.
   In win32: mount c D:\ would give you a C in DOSBox which points
   at D:\ in win32.
   In linux: mount c /home/username would give you a C in DOSBox
   which points at /home/username in Linux.

Q: The mouse doesn't work.
A: Normally dosbox detects the mouse being used by a game. If you click on 
   the screen then it should get locked and work.
   Sometimes the dosbox mouse detection doesn't work with certain games. You
   might have to force to lock the mouse then with ctrl-F10.

Q: The sound stutters.
A: You're using too much cpu power to keep dosbox running at the current speed.
   You can either lower the cycles or skip frames or get a faster machine.

================
The Config File:
================

A config file can be generated by CONFIG.COM. Edit it to customize DOSBox.
The file is divided into several sections (the names have [] around it). 
Some sections have options which you can set.
# and % indicate commentlines. 
The generated configfile contains the current settings. You can alter them and
start dosbox with the -conf switch to load the file and use these settings. 

==================
The Language File:
==================

A language file can be generated by CONFIG.COM. 
Read it and you will hopefully understand how to change it. 
Start Dosbox with the -lang switch to use your new language file
or you can setup the filename in the config file in the [dosbox] section.
There's a language= entry that can be changed with the filename.

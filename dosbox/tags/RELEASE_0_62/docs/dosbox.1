.SH FILES

.SH "SPECIAL KEYS"
.TP 12m
.IP ALT\-ENTER
Go full screen and back.
.IP CTRL\-F1
Start the keymapper.
.IP CTRL\-F4
Swap mounted disk-image (Only used with imgmount).
.IP CTRL\-F5
Save a screenshot.
.IP CTRL\-F6
Start/Stop recording sound output to a wave file.
.IP CTRL\-ALT\-F7
Start/Stop recording of OPL commands.
.IP CTRL\-ALT\-F8
Start/Stop the recording of raw MIDI commands.
.IP CTRL\-F7
Decrease frameskip.
.IP CTRL\-F8
Increase frameskip.
.IP CTRL\-F9
Kill dosbox.
.IP CTRL\-F10
Capture/Release the mouse.
.IP CTRL\-F11
Slow down emulation (Increase DOSBox Cycles).
.IP CTRL\-F12
Speed up emulation (Decrease DOSBox Cycles).
.PP
These are the default keybindings. They can be changed in the keymapper.
.PP
.BR "Note: " "Once you increase your " DOSBox " cycles beyond your computer's maximum
capacity, it will produce the same effect as slowing down the emulation.
This maximum will vary from computer to computer, there is no standard.
.SH "SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS"
Fast machine. My guess would be pentium\-2 400+ to get decent emulation
of games written for an 286 machine.
For protected mode games a 1 Ghz machine is recommended and don't expect
them to run fast though!! Be sure to read the next section on how to speed
it up somewhat.
.SS "To run resource\-demanding games"
.BR dosbox " emulates the CPU, the sound and graphic cards, and some other"
.RB " stuff, all at the same time. You can overclock " dosbox " by using CTRL\-F12, but"
you'll be limited by the power of your actual CPU. You can see how much free
time your true CPU has by various utils (top).  Once 100% of your real CPU time is
.RB "used there is no further way to speed up " dosbox " unless you reduce the load"
.RB "generated by the non\-CPU parts of " dosbox .
.PP
So:
.PP
.RB "Close every program but " dosbox .
.PP
.RB "Overclock  " dosbox " until 100% of your CPU is used.(CTR\-+F12)" 
.PP
.RB "Since VGA emulation is the most demanding part of " dosbox " in terms of actual"
CPU usage, we'll start here. Increase the number of frames skipped (in
increments of one) by pressing CRTL\-F8. Your CPU usage should decrease.
Go back one step and repeat this until the game runs fast enough for you.
Please note that this is a trade off: you lose in fluidity of video what you
gain in speed.
.SH NOTES
.RB "While we hope that, one day, " dosbox " will run virtually all programs ever made for the PC..."
.RB "we are not there yet. At present, " dosbox " run on a 1.7 Gigahertz PC is roughly the equivalent of a 25MHz 386 PC."
While the 0.60 release has added support for "protected mode" allowing for more complex and recent programs, 
but note that this support is early in development and nowhere near as complete as the support for 386 real\-mode 
games (or earlier). Also note that "protected mode" games need substantially more resources and may 
.RB "require a much faster processor for you to run it properly in " dosbox .
.SH BUGS
Not all DOS programs work properly.
.BR dosbox " will exit without warning if an error occured."
